# Global-COVID-19-Regression-Analysis

The following project aims to perform a multiple linear regression analysis of global COVID-19 infections, 
using COVID-19 deaths, population density, urban population percentage, Human-Development Index, and
WHO region as possible predictors.

In this repo, you will find the dataset we used to perform our analysis, as well as the R code for our statistical
analyses.
